Programming Best Practice

Look & Feel:
-	FIR should always be “on”.
-	Please include ss:listDisplay=”0” for grid question.
-	Please do not include ss:listDisplay=”0” for normal single / multiple punch.
-	Do not include height / width attributes for open end question text-box. Keep it as it is.
-	The size of input box should be as per the no. of digit that will be valid. If a question has valid range from 10 to 99 then the size of the input box should be 2.
-	If there are more than 10 statements in a grid then repeat the scale after every 5 statements.
-	Check the link on all device (Desktop / Laptop, Smartphones, Tablet) to make sure the question is setup properly on screen (without horizontal scroll-bar).
-	Anchor "Other" and "Exclusive" options.

Re-directs:
-	Please make sure we are passing the unique id in the redirects [Qualified, terminated, overquota].
-	The open survey will have a normal text as an end screen (won’t have any redirect unless specify).
-	For open survey’s there won’t be any unique id.

Survey setting:
-	Please make sure to remove the back button in live phase
-	Check if proper device enabled for the project
-	Check if progress-bar working properly
-	Browser dupes should be set as safe.

Basic:		
-	Check that rating scale syntax has been added to each rating scale	
-	Check and confirm that no “goto” conditions are present in the project	
-	Check and confirm that ""NOT"" condition programming is as per the requirement for that question/logic.  All the terminations are at the location where client has asked (i.e. at the end of the screener or after the question).	
-	Check that groups containing "exclusive codes" that do not need to be randomized and "Other" have been given an attribute of randomize= "0".

Autofill:		
-	Do all hidden questions should have the word "V" mentioned before them even if not specified in the q're. 
-	If hidden variables are only for the programming purpose then put where="notdp".
-	To punch a hidden marker (question) always write the exec block within the question.
-	For block / section randomization, always capture the randomization order.

Validations:		
-	Have res tags been used to declare custom error messages? This is for all the studies.	
-	Check that "unique" has been used for all ranking questions?	
-	Check that statements where only one answer can be given for any attributes should have a validate added? For eg., since the same statement cannot be selected as Least and Most Appealing a validate command needs to be added.	

Formatting:		
-	"Check that all numeric questions have width added to take care that the length is just one more than the highest no.?
-	That is, if the highest number is ""99"" then the width should be ""2"""	
-	For all total questions, please add "autosum" by default.	
-	For any grid questions / radio / checkbox questions containing an exclusive "None of the above/ Don't know" response at the end, in case we have "Other/Other (please specify)" option in this list, need to fix (do not randomize) this options before None of the above/ Don't know".	
-	Have all "other/NA" codes been added to "randomize="0"".	
-	Make sure the option text is always shown on the right in case of a checkbox or radio	

Quotas:		
-	Make sure try to call all the quotas in one sheet as per the requirement.	
-	In case of quota sheets where the same marker is used across quota tables, use # doit="1" #, when we are calling all the quotas in one sheet.	
-	Has a Total quota been added irrespective if specified or not in the qnre? To track the overall quota rather than calculating all the numbers.	
-	Has a Sample partner specific quota been added irrespective if specified or not in the qnre? This is applicable if more than one sample partner in the study.	
-	Has the structure been confirmed with client, need to send the quota screen view URL while asking the queries.	
-	In case of a multi punch quota, make sure that "cell:<No. of maximum allowed cells>" is mentioned.	
-	There shouldn’t be any "space" or any special character (apart from underscore) while assigning name to any quota.
-	If the quota is based upon couple of questions then try to keep all the quota's within same excel sheet.
-	Provide quota cell variable label as per the question option label
-	Please use "1" instead of "plus"
-	Call quota element after the question on which it’s based.

Pipe-In:		
-	Check the case of the insertions i.e. if needed to be shown in lower or upper case or in the same case as mentioned in the previous question.
	
Data Quality:		
-	Check if speeders need to be programmed in the study?	
-	"If Speeders present, check if the respondent should be terminated or flagged? (Shell has termination syntax)
-	If flagged, confirm that a marker is present that saves if the respondent has been flagged as a speeder."	
-	If Speeders present, check if the logic should be "lesser than" or "lesser than or equal to"? (Standard shell has 'lesser than or equal to')	
-	Check if Straight liners need to be programmed in the study?	
-	If Straighliners present, check if the respondent should be terminated or flagged?
-	If flagged, confirm that a marker is present that saves if the respondent has been flagged as a straight liner.	
-	If Straighliners present, check the logic that has been used and confirm if it is right.	

Media:		
-	Check if we need to apply any security measure on the media?
-	Check that a script has been added to avoid auto-submitting a video question.	
-	If more than one video, need to make sure videos are assign as per the cell quota.	
-	Check that a script has been added to avoid auto-start a video question.	
-	Verify images are clear, undistorted and sized properly.	

Device testing:		
-	Check the survey link in mobile  iOS & Android is case survey going live for the mobile users	
-	Check pages, questions, rows are loading and alignment is correct.	
-	Check any images/videos can be viewed properly/entirely.	
-	Check any links/concepts/pop-ups are opening and shown properly.	
-	Check the survey link in tablets is case survey going live for the mobile users
	
Browser testing:		
-	Check the test link in all major browsers [chrome, Firefox, IE 11 and Safari].	

General:
-	For Don’t know / Not sure option please always add [aggregate="0" percentages="0"] attributes.
-	Please add setting [type=”rating”] for rating question.
-	Please do not validate Other specify box for numbers.
-	Please make sure to include error messages in res tags.
-	Make labels and values match if possible. The positive one will have higher value than negative one. Also, if needed get it clarified.
-	For rowCond, we should use Q[row] instead of Q[row.index].
-	To make a multi punch question optional, please use at least=0.
-	The unique variable should always be declared as "autosavekey"
-	If there is any pipe-in in the question text / option text then please use "alt" and add appropriate text into it so that one can able to understand when refers to report.
-	Verify Top2/Bottom2 nets in the report are correctly capturing data (and/or Top3/Bottom3 nets)
