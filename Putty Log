Zip file export (translation + *.html)

The first format will read all survey's text resources and write them

The second format will take the existing survey, load in the changes
form translation.xls (warning about changed original texts) and write
out a new file.

Note that if using just a spreadsheet, the first argument is a survey
name (e.g. demo/recode) but the third is a survey.xml location (e.g.
demo/recode/survey-translated.xml) or an existing survey path.

If you are using zip file bundles, the third argument must be an
existing survey.

Cannot load survey Trfrench_07V1.xls
[vibhuti.narayansingh@gemini.decipherinc 429734]$ xlate --dupes -lfrench Trfrench_07V1.xls
xlate -- import/export translation Excel worksheets
Usage:
   xlate [--dupes] <survey> <translation.xls>
   xlate <survey> <translation.xls> <new survey.xml>

Zip file export (translation + *.html)
   xlate <survey> <translation.zip>
   xlate <survey> <translation.zip> <new survey>

The first format will read all survey's text resources and write them
to translation.xls.

The second format will take the existing survey, load in the changes
form translation.xls (warning about changed original texts) and write
out a new file.

Note that if using just a spreadsheet, the first argument is a survey
name (e.g. demo/recode) but the third is a survey.xml location (e.g.
demo/recode/survey-translated.xml) or an existing survey path.

If you are using zip file bundles, the third argument must be an
existing survey.

You will be prompted before files are overwritten.
